-- Library-size scaling (TSS) and median-of-ratios (RLE) over exact rationals:
-- the parts of `tss_factors`, `rle_factors` and `_median` in
-- `src/analysis/differential.jl` (branch feat/differential-abundance-nb,
-- commit 6c3e8b2) that are statements about rational arithmetic, proved; the
-- parts that are not, named.
--
-- What is NOT modelled, and why:
--
--   * Geometric means, `exp` and `log`.  Julia centres each factor vector by
--     its geometric mean (`_geomean`), RLE divides each count by its taxon's
--     geometric mean, and the model uses `log` of the factors as offsets.
--     None of these is a rational function, and a geometric mean of
--     rationals is in general irrational, so none can be computed over ℚ.
--     Wherever Julia divides by a geometric mean, the theorems below divide
--     by an ARBITRARY positive rational `g`.  The same algebra holds over the
--     reals for any positive divisor, but that transfer is an argument, not a
--     theorem here.  In particular the scale invariance D1 tests
--     (`tss_factors(7.5 .* fixture) ≈ f`) is a property of the geometric
--     mean and is not proved.
--   * Floating point.  Julia computes in Float64; these are exact statements.
--     A refusal can fire in floating point (underflow to 0.0) where the exact
--     quantity is positive; that is not modelled.
--
-- D1's `tss_factors` computes library sizes (row sums of the samples x taxa
-- matrix) and centres them; it never forms proportions.  The proportion
-- theorems below are the relative-abundance reading of TSS asked for in the
-- D2 brief, and hold for any row with a positive total.
--
-- Theorems (names as in docs/formal/agda-bh-scaling-proofs.md):
--
--   total-positive        a row of non-negative counts with at least one
--                         positive count has a positive total (so TSS's
--                         `l > 0` refusal fires exactly on all-zero rows)
--   proportions-sum-to-1  a row's proportions sum to 1
--   proportions-bounded   every proportion lies in [0, 1]
--   centre-positive       dividing by any positive g keeps every factor positive
--   centre-monotone       ... and keeps their order
--   ratio-positive        a positive count over a positive normaliser is positive
--   median-positive       the median (as `_median` takes it) of a non-empty list
--                         of positive ratios is positive, so once one taxon has
--                         reads in every sample, every RLE factor is positive in
--                         exact arithmetic
