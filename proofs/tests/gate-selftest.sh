# Prove that the proof gate can fail.
#
# A gate that has never been observed to reject anything is not evidence.  This
# script takes a throwaway copy of the proof tree, breaks it in one specific way
# at a time, and requires the gate to reject it.  If any mutation is *accepted*,
# or if a mutation failed to apply at all, this script exits non-zero.
#
# It runs in CI.  A gate whose self-test is skipped is a gate nobody can trust,
# so there is no flag to turn this off.
#
# Usage: proofs/tests/gate-selftest.sh
