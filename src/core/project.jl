        new_project(name; data_dir, projects_dir, config_dir)

    Bootstrap a project for the study named `name`.

    Pipeline configuration stubs (`pipeline.yml`) are created inside the data
    tree (`data_dir/{name}/`) so that inputs and their settings are co-located.
    Edit those files before (re-)running the pipeline. Omitted keys inherit from
    the nearest ancestor, falling back to `config/defaults/pipeline.yml`.

    Output directories are created under `projects_dir/{name}/` mirroring the
    data layout. They contain only pipeline outputs and the auto-generated
    `run_config.yml` (the fully-merged configuration actually used).

    `databases.yml`, `tools.yml`, and `primers.yml` are copied from
    `config/defaults/` on first run (edit them in place; they are not cascaded).

    Re-running `new_project` never overwrites existing files.

    Returns a `Vector{ProjectCtx}`, one per leaf run.
