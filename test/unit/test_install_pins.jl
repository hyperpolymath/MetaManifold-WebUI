## Pinning of external tools and runtimes
#
# These tests police the pins themselves rather than any behaviour of the pipeline.
# They exist because the failure they guard against is silent: an installer that
# takes whatever upstream published most recently still installs, still passes, and
# still produces results, and nothing anywhere records that two runs were made by
# different software. The only defence is to assert that the pins are declared, that
# they are declared in one place, and that every copy of them agrees.
