# Evidence for issue #21's zero handling (docs/statistics/zero-handling.md).
#
# The numbers asserted here are the pinned fixture in test/fixtures/issue21/golden.json.
# They were derived from the published methods (Martín-Fernández et al. 2003 and 2015) and
# from zCompositions::multRepl / cmultRepl, not from this module — see the fixture's
# `generator` block for how they were produced and where the fixture stops being
# independent. They are a pinned expectation until test/reference/issue21_reference.jl
# reproduces them in Julia; this file is what turns them into a gate.
#
# Where R is available (CI installs it) the module is also compared against the reference
# packages directly, and that comparison is the strongest evidence in this file. Where R is
# absent those tests report a skip rather than a pass.
