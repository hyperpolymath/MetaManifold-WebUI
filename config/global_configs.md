# Global Configuration

In this directory is the machine-level override. Anything written here
applies to every study run on this installation, regardless of project.

This is the right place for settings that reflect the environment: which
remote server handles taxonomy assignment, how many threads this machine
can spare, as well as primers available to be picked by cutadapt. If you
are a contributer, your configurations here will not be committed.

Leave a key out entirely to inherit the default. Only write what you
deliberately want to change.

Note that this is the lowest-precedence level after the defaults. Any
setting written here can be overridden at the project, group, or run
level, this simply serves as the fallback for every run that does not
explicitly override it.
